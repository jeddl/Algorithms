# 3 Sum
## Example
Given an array `S` of `n` integers, are there elements `a, b, c` in `S` such that `a + b + c = 0`. Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Elements in a triplet `(a,b,c)` must be in non-descending order. `(ie, a ≤ b ≤ c)`. 
The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

## Solution
- Sort the array first
- 2 pointers + 1 pointer
