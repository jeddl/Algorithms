# Maximum Product Subarray
## Example
Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

For example, given the array `[2,3,-2,4]`, the contiguous subarray `[2,3]` has the largest `product = 6`.

## Solution
- Dynamic Programming
- Tow arrays:
 - One for the temperary max value and one for the temperary min value
 - Consider nagative numbers
