Given n nodes in a graph labeled from 1 to n. There is no edges in the graph at beginning.

You need to support the following method:

- `connect(a, b)`, add an edge to connect node `a` and node `b`. 
- `query(a, b)`, check if two nodes are connected

e.g. 
```
5 // n = 5
query(1, 2) return false
connect(1, 2)
query(1, 3) return false
connect(2, 4)
query(1, 4) return true
```

## Solution
- Union Find
