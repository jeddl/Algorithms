# Intersection of Two Linked List
## Example
The following two linked lists:
```
A:          a1 → a2
                   ↘
                     c1 → c2 → c3
                   ↗            
B:     b1 → b2 → b3
```

A and B begin to intersect at node c1.

## Solution:
- Create a Linked List cycle
- Slow node and fast node
