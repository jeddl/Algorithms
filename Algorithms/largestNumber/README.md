# Largest Number
## Example
Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number. (The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.)

e.g. 
Given `[1, 20, 23, 4, 8]`, the largest formed number is `8423201`.

## Solution
- Convert integer to string
- String comparator
- Corner case: "0000..."
